# columba

Columba is a simple web application that mirrors user text fields in rooms. It uses Socket.io under the hood together 
with SvelteKit.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open

# or start the production server with
pnpm start
```
